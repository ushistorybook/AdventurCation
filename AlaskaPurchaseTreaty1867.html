      <p><b>Alaska Purchase Treaty, 1867</b></p>
      <p>Treaties and other International Agreements of the United States, 1776-1947, 
        ed. Charles I. Bevans, p. 1216-1219 </p>
      <p>ALASKA PURCHASE TREATY, 1867 </p>
      <p>The United States of America and His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, 
        being desirous of strengthening, if possible, the good understanding which 
        exists between them, have, for that purpose, appointed as their Plenipotentiaries: 
        the President of the United States, William H. Seward, Secretary of State; 
        and His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, the Privy Counsellor Edward 
        de Stoeckl, his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the 
        United States. </p>
      <p>And the said Plenipotentiaries, having exchanged their full powers, which 
        were found to be in due form, have agreed upon and signed the following 
        articles: </p>
      <p>Article I </p>
      <p>His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias agrees to cede to the United 
        States, by this convention, immediately upon the exchange of the ratifications 
        thereof, all the territory and dominion now possessed by his said Majesty 
        on the continent of America and in the adjacent islands, the same being 
        contained within the geographical limits herein set forth, to wit: The 
        eastern limit is the line of demarcation between the Russian and the British 
        possessions in North America, as established by the convention between 
        Russia and Great Britain, of February 28-16, 1825, and described in Articles 
        III and IV of said convention, in the following terms: </p>
      <p>''Commencing from the southernmost point of the island called Prince 
        of Wales Island, which point lies in the parallel of 54 degrees 40 minutes 
        north latitude, and between the 131st and the 133d degree of west longitude, 
        (meridian of Greenwich,) the said line shall ascend to the north along 
        the channel called Portland channel, as far as the point of the continent 
        where it strikes the 56th degree of north latitude; from this last mentioned 
        point, the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains 
        situated parallel to the coast as far as the point of intersection of 
        the 141st degree of west longitude, (of the same meridian;) and finally, 
        from the said point of intersection, the said meridian line of the 141st 
        degree, in its prolongation as far as the Frozen ocean. </p>
      <p>''IV. With reference to the line of demarcation laid down in the preceding 
        article, it is understood&#151; </p>
      <p>''1st. That the island called Prince of Wales Island shall belong wholly 
        to Russia,'' (now, by this cession, to the United States.) </p>
      <p>''2d. That whenever the summit of the mountains which extend in a direction 
        parallel to the coast from the 56th degree of north latitude to the point 
        of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude shall prove to be 
        at the distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit 
        between the British possessions and the line of coast which is to belong 
        to Russia as above mentioned (that is to say, the limit to the possessions 
        ceded by this convention) shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding 
        of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine 
        leagues therefrom.'' </p>
      <p>The western limit within which the territories and dominion conveyed, 
        are contained, passes through a point in Behring's straits on the parallel 
        of sixty-five degrees thirty minutes north latitude, at its intersection 
        by the meridian which passes midway between the islands of Krusenstern, 
        or Ignalook, and the island of Ratmanoff, or Noonarbook, and proceeds 
        due north, without limitation, into the same Frozen ocean. The same western 
        limit, beginning at the same initial point, proceeds thence in a course 
        nearly southwest, through Behring's straits and Behring's sea, so as to 
        pass midway between the northwest point of the island of St. Lawrence 
        and the southeast point of Cape Choukotski, to the meridian of one hundred 
        and seventy-two west longitude; thence, from the intersection of that 
        meridian, in a southwesterly direction, so as to pass midway between the 
        island of Attou and the Copper island of the Kormandorski couplet or group 
        in the North Pacific ocean, to the meridian of one hundred and ninety-three 
        degrees west longitude, so as to include in the territory conveyed the 
        whole of the Aleutian islands east of that meridian. </p>
      <p>Article II </p>
      <p>In the cession of territory and dominion made by the preceding article, 
        are included the right of property in all public lots and squares, vacant 
        lands, and all public buildings, fortifications, barracks, and other edifices 
        which are not private individual property. It is, however, understood 
        and agreed, that the churches which have been built in the ceded territory 
        by the Russian government, shall remain the property of such members of 
        the Greek Oriental Church resident in the territory, as may choose to 
        worship therein. Any government archives, papers, and documents relative 
        to the territory and dominion aforesaid, which may be now existing there, 
        will be left in the possession of the agent of the United States; but 
        an authenticated copy of such of them as may be required, will be, at 
        all times, given by the United States to the Russian government, or to 
        such Russian officers or subjects, as they may apply for. </p>
      <p>Article III </p>
      <p>The inhabitants of the ceded territory, according to their choice, reserving 
        their natural allegiance, may return to Russia within three years; but 
        if they should prefer to remain in the ceded territory, they, with the 
        exception of uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment 
        of all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United 
        States, and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of 
        their liberty, property and religion. The uncivilized tribes will be subject 
        to such laws and regulations as the United States may, from time to time, 
        adopt in regard to aboriginal tribes of that country. </p>
      <p>Article IV </p>
      <p>His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias shall appoint, with convenient 
        despatch, an agent or agents for the purpose of formally delivering to 
        a similar agent or agents appointed on behalf of the United States, the 
        territory, dominion, property, dependencies and appurtenances which are 
        ceded as above, and for doing any other act which may be necessary in 
        regard thereto. But the cession, with the right of immediate possession, 
        is nevertheless to be deemed complete and absolute on the exchange of 
        ratifications, without waiting for such formal delivery. </p>
      <p>Article V </p>
      <p>Immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of this convention, 
        any fortifications or military posts which may be in the ceded territory, 
        shall be delivered to the agent of the United States, and any Russian 
        troops which may be in the territory shall be withdrawn as soon as may 
        be reasonably and conveniently practicable. </p>
      <p>Article VI </p>
      <p>In consideration of the cession aforesaid, the United States agree to 
        pay at the treasury in Washington, within ten months after the exchange 
        of the ratifications of this convention, to the diplomatic representative 
        or other agent of his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, duly authorized 
        to receive the same, seven million two hundred thousand dollars in gold. 
        The cession of territory and dominion herein made is hereby declared to 
        be free and unincumbered by any reservations, privileges, franchises, 
        grants, or possessions, by any associated companies, whether corporate 
        or incorporate, Russian or any other, or by any parties, except merely 
        private individual property holders; and the cession hereby made, conveys 
        all the rights, franchises, and privileges now belonging to Russia in 
        the said territory or dominion, and appurtenances thereto. </p>
      <p>Article VII </p>
      <p>When this Convention shall have been duly ratified by the President of 
        the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, on 
        the one part, and on the other by his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, 
        the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington within three months 
        from the date hereof, or sooner, if possible. </p>
      <p>In faith whereof, the respective plenipotentiaries have signed this convention, 
        and thereto affixed the seals of their arms. </p>
      <p>Done at Washington, the thirtieth day of March in the year of our Lord 
        one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven. </p>
