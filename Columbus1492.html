        Galicia, of Majorca, of Minorca, of Sevil, of Sardinia, of Jaen, of Algarve,

      <p>For as much of you, Christopher Columbus, are going by our command, with 
        some of our vessels and men, to discover and subdue some Islands and Continent 
        in the ocean, and it is hoped that by God's assistance, some of the said 
        Islands and Continent in the ocean will be discovered and conquered by 
        your means and conduct, therefore it is but just and reasonable, that 
        since you expose yourself to such danger to serve us, you should be rewarded 
        for it. And we being willing to honour and favour you for the reasons 
        aforesaid: Our will is, that you, Christopher Columbus, after discovering 
        and conquering the said Islands and Continent in the said ocean, or any 
        of them, shall be our Admiral of the said Islands and Continent you shall 
        so discover and conquer; and that you be our Admiral, Vice-Roy, and Governour 
        in them, and that for the future, you may call and stile yourself, D. 
        Christopher Columbus, and that your sons and successors in the said employment, 
        may call themselves Dons, Admirals, Vice-Roys, and Governours of them; 
        and that you may exercise the office of Admiral, with the charge of Vice-Roy 
        and Governour of the said Islands and Continent, which you and your Lieutenants 
        shall conquer, and freely decide all causes, civil and criminal, appertaining 
        to the said employment of Admiral, Vice-Roy, and Governour, as you shall 
        think fit in justice, and as the Admirals of our kingdoms use to do; and 
        that you have power to punish offenders; and you and your Lieutenants 
        exercise the employments of Admiral, Vice-Roy, and Governour, in all things 
        belonging to the said offices, or any of them; and that you enjoy the 
        perquisites and salaries belonging to the said employments, and to each 
        of them, in the same manner as the High Admiral of our kingdom does. And 
        by this our letter, or a copy of it signed by a Public Notary: We command 
        Prince John, our most dearly beloved Son, the Infants, Dukes, Prelates, 
        Marquesses, Great Masters and Military Orders, Priors, Commendaries, our 
        Counsellors, Judges, and other Officers of Justice whatsoever, belonging 
        to our Household, Courts, and Chancery, and Constables of Castles, Strong 
        Houses, and others; and all Corporations, Bayliffs, Governours, Judges, 
        Commanders, Sea Officers; and the Aldermen, Common Council, Officers, 
        and Good People of all Cities, Lands, and Places in our Kingdoms and Dominions, 
        and in those you shall conquer and subdue, and the captains, masters, 
        mates, and other officers and sailors, our natural subjects now being, 
        or that shall be for the time to come, and any of them, that when you 
        shall have discovered that said Islands and Continent in the ocean; and 
        you, or any that shall have your commission, shall have taken the usual 
        oath in such cases, that they for the future, look upon you as long as 
        you live, and after you, your son and heir, and so from one heir to another 
        forever, as our Admiral on our said Ocean, and as Vice-Roy an Governour 
        of the said Islands and Continent, by you, Christopher Columbus, discovered 
        and conquered; and that they treat you and your Lieutenants, by you appointed, 
        for executing the employments of Admiral, Vice-Roy, and Governour, as 
        such in all respects, and give you all the perquisites and other things 
        belonging and appertaining to the said offices; and allow, and cause to 
        be allowed you, all the honours, graces, concessions, prehaminences, prerogatives, 
        immunities, and other things, or any of them which are due to you, by 
        virtue of your commands of Admiral, Vice-roy, and Governour, and to be 
        observed completely, so that nothing be diminished; and that they make 
        no objection to this, or any part of it, nor suffer it to be made; forasmuch 
        as we from this time forward, by this our letter, bestow on you the employments 
        of Admiral, Vice-Roy, and perpetual Governour forever; and we put you 
        into possession of the said offices, and of every of them, and full power 
        to use and exercise them, and to receive the perquisites and salaries 
        belonging to them, or any of them, as was said above. Concerning all which 
        things, if it be requisite, and you shall desire it. We command our Chancellour, 
        Notaries, and other Officers, to pass, seal, and deliver to you, our Letter 
        of Privilege, in such form and legal manner, as you shall require our 
        stand in need of. And that none of them presume to do any thing to the 
        contrary, upon pain of our displeasure, and forfeiture of 30 ducats for 
        each offence. And we command him, who show them this our Letter, that 
        he summon them to appear before us at our Court, where we shall then be, 
        within fifteen days after such summons, under the said penalty. Under 
        which same, we also command any Public Notary whatsoever, that he give 
        to him that shows it him, a certificate under his seal, that we may know 
        how our command is obeyed. </p>
