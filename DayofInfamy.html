      <p><b>President Franklin Roosevelt's ''Day of Infamy'' Speech, 1941</b></p>
      <p>The Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Franklin Delano 
        Roosevelt, 1941, p.300-301</p>
      <p>The Capitol, December 8, 1941</p>
      <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Yesterday, December 7, 1941&#151;a date which 
        will live in infamy&#151;the United States of America was suddenly and 
        deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The United States was at peace with that nation 
        and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its 
        Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in 
        the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced 
        bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the 
        United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a 
        formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated 
        that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, 
        it contained no threat or hint of war of armed attack.</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii 
        from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many 
        days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time the Japanese Government 
        has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements 
        and expressions of hope for continued peace.</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands 
        has caused severe damage to American</b></font> naval and military forces, 
        I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In 
        addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas 
        between San Francisco and Honolulu.</p>
      <p>Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya.</p>
      <p>Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam.</p>
      <p>Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.</p>
      <p>Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island.</p>
      <p>And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.</p>
      <p>Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout 
        the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. 
        The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and 
        well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.</p>
      <p>As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures 
        be taken for our defense.</p>
      <p>But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught 
        against us.</p>
      <p>No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, 
        the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute 
        victory.</p>
      <p>I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people 
        when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost 
        but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never 
        again endanger us.</p>
      <p>Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, 
        our territory and our interests are in grave danger.</p>
      <p>With confidence in our armed forces&#151;with the unbounding determination 
        of our people&#151;we will gain the inevitable triumph&#151;so help us 
        God.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>I ask that the Congress declare that since the 
        unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December seventh, 
        1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese 
        Empire. </b></font><br>
