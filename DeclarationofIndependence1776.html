      </p>
      <p>DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE </p>
      <p>When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people 
        to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, 
        and to assume among the powers of earth the separate and equal station 
        to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle them, a decent 
        respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the 
        causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
      <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; 
        that they are endowed by their Creator with inherent and inalienable rights; 
        that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that 
        to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving 
        their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any 
        form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right 
        of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, 
        laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in 
        such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and 
        happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established 
        should not be changed for light and transient causes. And accordingly 
        all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while 
        evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms 
        to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, 
        begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object, 
        evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their 
        right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide 
        new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance 
        of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them 
        to expunge their former systems of government. The history of the present 
        king of Great Britain is a history of unremitting injuries and usurpations, 
        among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of 
        the rest, but all have in direct object the establishment of an absolute 
        tyranny over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid 
        world, for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.</p>
      <p>He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for 
        the public good.</p>
      <p>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing 
        importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should 
        be obtained; and when so suspended, he has neglected utterly to attend 
        to them.</p>
      <p>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts 
        of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation 
        in the legislature; a right in-estimable to them, and formidable to tyrants 
        only.</p>
      <p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, 
        and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole 
        purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
      <p>He has dissolved Representative houses repeatedly and continually, for 
        opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
      <p>He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others 
        to be elected whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, 
        have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the state remaining 
        in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and 
        convulsions within.</p>
      <p>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that 
        purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing 
        to pass others to encourage their migrations hither; and raising the conditions 
        of new appropriations of lands.</p>
      <p>He has suffered the administration of justice totally to cease in some 
        of these states, refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary 
        powers.</p>
      <p>He has made our judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of 
        their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>
      <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices by a self-assumed power, and 
        sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their 
        substance.</p>
      <p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies and ships of 
        war, without the consent of our legislatures.</p>
      <p>He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, 
        the civil power.</p>
      <p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to 
        our constitutions and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to 
        their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed 
        troops among us;</p>
      <p>For protecting them by a mock-trial from punishment for any murders which 
        they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;</p>
      <p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;</p>
      <p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent;</p>
      <p>For depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury;</p>
      <p>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses;</p>
      <p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, 
        establishing therein in arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries 
        so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing 
        the same absolute rule into these states;</p>
      <p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and 
        altering fundamentally the forms of our governments;</p>
      <p>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves to be invested 
        with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>
      <p>He has abdicated government here, withdrawing his governors, and declaring 
        us out of his allegiance and protection.</p>
      <p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed 
        the lives of our people.</p>
      <p>He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries, 
        to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun 
        with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized 
        nation.</p>
      <p>He has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless 
        Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction 
        of all ages, sexes, and conditions of existence.</p>
      <p>He has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow citizens, with 
        the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation of property.</p>
      <p>He has constrained others, taken captives on the high seas, to bear arms 
        against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and 
        brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p>
      <p>He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most 
        sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people, 
        who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in 
        another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation 
        thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is 
        the warfare of the Christian king of Great Britain. Determined to keep 
        open a market where MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted 
        his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or 
        restrain this execrable commerce; and that this assemblage of horrors 
        might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very 
        people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which 
        he has deprived them, by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded 
        them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of 
        one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives 
        of another.</p>
      <p>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redness in 
        the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only 
        by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act 
        which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean 
        to be free. Future ages will scarce believe that the hardiness of one 
        man adventured, within the short compass of twelve years only, to lay 
        a foundation, so broad and undisguised, for tyranny over a people fostered 
        and fixed in principles of freedom.</p>
      <p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have 
        warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend 
        a jurisdiction over these our states. We have reminded them of the circumstances 
        of our emigration and settlement here, no one of which could warrant so 
        strange a pretension: that these were affected at the expence of our own 
        blood and treasure, unassisted by the wealth or the strength of Great 
        Britain: that in constituting indeed our several forms of government, 
        we had adopted one common king, thereby laying a foundation for perpetual 
        league and amity with them: but that submission to their parliament was 
        no part of our constitution, nor ever in idea, if history may be credited: 
        and we appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, as well as to 
        the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which were 
        likely to interrupt our condition and correspondence. They too have been 
        deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity; and when occasions 
        have been given them, by the regular course of their laws, of removing 
        from their councils the disturbers of our harmony, they have by their 
        free election re-established them in power. At this very time, too, they 
        are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of 
        our common blood, but Scotch and foreign mercenaries to invade and destroy 
        us. These facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection; and manly 
        spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren. We must therefore 
        endeavor to forget our former love for them, and to hold them as we hold 
        the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We might have been 
        a great and free people together; but a communication of grandeur and 
        of freedom, it seems, is below their dignity. Be it so, since they will 
        have it. The road to happiness and to glory is open to us too; we will 
        climb it apart from them, and acquiesce in the necessity which denounces 
        our eternal separation!</p>
      <p>We therefore the Representatives of the United States of America in General 
        Congress assembled, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people 
        of these states, reject and renounce all allegiance and subjection to 
        the kings of Great Britain, and all others who may hereafter claim by, 
        through, or under them; we utterly dissolve all political connection which 
        may heretofore have subsisted between us and the people or parliament 
        of Great Britain; and finally we do assert and declare these colonies 
        to be free and independent states, and that as free and independent states, 
        they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, 
        establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent 
        states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, we mutually 
        pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. <br>
