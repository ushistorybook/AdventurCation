      <p><b>President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, 1863</b></p>
      <p>Living Documents in American History (ed. John A. Scott, Vol. II, p. 
        646) </p>
      <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, 
        a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that 
        all men are created equal.</p>
      <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation 
        or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met 
        on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion 
        of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their 
        lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper 
        that we should do this.</p>
      <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate&#151;we can not consecrate&#151;we 
        can not hallow&#151;this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled 
        here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 
        The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it 
        can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, 
        to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here 
        have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated 
        to the great task remaining before us&#151;that from these honored dead 
        we take increased devotion to that cause for they which gave the last 
        full measure of devotion&#151;that we here highly resolve that these dead 
        shall not have died in vain&#151;that this nation, under God, shall have 
        a new birth of freedom&#151;and that government of the people, by the 
        people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. <br>
