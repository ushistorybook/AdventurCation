<p>''I HAVE A DREAM'' </p>
<p>Speech by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Historic ''March on Washington'' 
  Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C., August 28, 1963 </p>
<p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest 
  demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. </p>
<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, 
  signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This <br>
  momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves 
  who had been seared in the flames of withering<br>
  injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. 
</p>
<p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years 
  later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the <br>
  manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years 
  later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the<br>
  midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity; one hundred years later, the Negro 
  is still languished in the corners of American society <br>
  and finds himself in exile in his own land. </p>
<p>So we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've 
  come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When <br>
  the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution 
  and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing <br>
  a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was the 
  promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white <br>
  men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit 
  of happiness. </p>
<p>It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so 
  far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of <br>
  honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; 
  a check which has come back marked ''insufficient <br>
  funds.'' But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse 
  to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great <br>
  vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check, 
  a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom <br>
  and the security of justice.'' </p>
<p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency 
  of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of <br>
  cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time 
  to make real the promises of democracy; now is the time <br>
  to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path 
  of racial justice; now is the time to lift our nation from the <br>
  quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood; now is the 
  time to make justice a reality for all God's children. It would <br>
  be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering 
  summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass <br>
  until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. </p>
<p>Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that 
  the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be <br>
  content, will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. 
  There will be neither rest nor tranquillity in America until <br>
  the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue 
  to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright <br>
  day of justice emerges. </p>
<p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the worn 
  threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the <br>
  process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. 
  Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by <br>
  drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our 
  struggle on the high plain of dignity and discipline. We <br>
  must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again 
  and again we must rise to the majestic heights of <br>
  meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy, which has 
  engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a <br>
  distrust of all white people. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by 
  their presence here today, have come to realize that their <br>
  destiny is tied up with out destiny. And they have come to realize that their 
  freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot <br>
  walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march 
  ahead. We cannot turn back. </p>
<p>There are those who are asking he devotees of Civil Rights. ''When will you 
  be satisfied?'' We can never be satisfied as long as the <br>
  Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality; we can never 
  be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue <br>
  of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of 
  the cities; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic <br>
  mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one; we can never be satisfied 
  as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed <br>
  of their dignity by signs stating. ''For White Only;'' we cannot be satisfied 
  as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in <br>
  New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No! No, we are not satisfied, 
  and we will not be satisfied until ''justice rolls down <br>
  like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.'' </p>
<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and 
  tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail <br>
  cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you 
  battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by <br>
  the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. 
  Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is <br>
  redemptive. Go back to Mississippi: Go back to Alabama: Go back to South Carolina: 
  Go back to Georgia: Go back to Louisiana: Go <br>
  back to the slums and ghettos of our Northern cities, knowing that somehow this 
  situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in <br>
  the valley of despair. </p>
<p>So I say to you, my friends, that even though we face the difficulties of today 
  and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply <br>
  rooted in the American dream, <b><font color="#FF0000">that one day this nation 
  will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, ''we hold these truths 
  to be <br>
  self-evident, that all men are created equal.'' I have a dream that one day 
  on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons <br>
  of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 
  I have a dream that one day even the state of <br>
  Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with 
  the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of <br>
  freedom and justice. I have a dream my four little children will one day live 
  in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of <br>
  their skin, but by the content of their character. </font></b></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>I Have a Dream Today! </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>I have a dream that one day in Alabama ~~~ with its 
  vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with the words of 
  <br>
  interposition and nullification&#151;one day right there in Alabama, little 
  black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little <br>
  white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>I Have a Dream Today! </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be 
  exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be 
  plain <br>
  and the crooked places will be made straight ''and the glory of the Lord shall 
  be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.'' </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back 
  to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain 
  of despair, <br>
  a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords 
  of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. <br>
  With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle 
  together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom <br>
  together, knowing that we will be free one day. And this will be the day. This 
  will be the day when all of God's children will be able to <br>
  sing with new meaning, ''My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of 
  thee I sing. Land where my father died, land of the pilgrim's <br>
  pride, from every mountain side, let freedom ring.'' And if America is to be 
  a great nation, this must become true. </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of 
  New Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom 
  <br>
  ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from 
  the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado; let freedom ring from <br>
  the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that. Let freedom ring from 
  Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout <br>
  Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and mole hill of Mississippi. 
  ''From every mountainside, let freedom ring.'' And <br>
  when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from 
  every village and every hamlet from every state and every <br>
  city, we will be able to speed up that day when all God's children, black men 
  and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, <br>
  will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: 
  ''Free at last; </b><font color="#000000">thank God Almighty, we are free at 
  last.'' </font><b><br>
