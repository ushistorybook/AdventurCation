      <p>TO THE PERSON SITTING IN DARKNESS </p>
      <p>The purpose of this article is not to describe the terrible offences 
        against humanity committed in the name of Politics in some of the most 
        notorious East Side districts. They could not be described, even verbally. 
        But it is the intention to let the great mass of more or less careless 
        citizens of this beautiful metropolis of the New World get some conception 
        of the havoc and ruin wrought to man, woman and child in the most densely 
        populated and least known section of the city. Name, date and place can 
        be supplied to those of little faith&#151;or to any man who feels himself 
        aggrieved. It is a plain statement of record and observation, written 
        without license and without garnish. </p>
      <p>Imagine, if you can, a section of the city territory completely dominated 
        by one man, without whose permission neither legitimate nor illegitimate 
        business can be conducted; where illegitimate business is encouraged and 
        legitimate business discouraged; where the respectable residents have 
        to fasten their doors and windows summer nights and sit in their rooms 
        with asphyxiating air and 100-degree temperature, rather than try to catch 
        the faint whiff of breeze in their natural breathing places, the stoops 
        of their homes; where naked women dance by night in the streets, and unsexed 
        men prowl like vultures through the darkness on 'business' not only permitted 
        but encouraged by the police; where the education of infants begins with 
        the knowledge of prostitution and the training of little girls is training 
        in the arts of Phryne; where American girls brought up with the refinements 
        of American homes are imported from small towns up-State, Massachusetts, 
        Connecticut and New Jersey, and kept as virtually prisoners as if they 
        were locked up behind jail bars until they have lost semblance of womanhood; 
        where small boys are taught to solicit for the women of disorderly houses; 
        where there is an organized society of young men whose sole business in 
        life is to corrupt young girls and turn them over to bawdy houses; where 
        men walking with their wives along the street are openly insulted; where 
        children that have adult diseases are the chief patrons of the hospitals 
        and dispensaries; where it is the rule, rather than the exception, that 
        murder, rape, robbery and theft go unpunished &#151;in short where the 
        Premium of the most awful forms of Vice is the Profit of the politicians.'' 
      </p>
      <p>The following news from China appeared in The Sun, of New York, on Christmas 
        Eve. The italics are mine: </p>
      <p>The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has returned 
        from a trip which he made for the purpose of collecting indemnities for 
        damages done by Boxers. Everywhere he went he compelled the Chinese to 
        pay. He says that all his native Christians are now provided for. He had 
        700 of them under his charge, and 300 were killed. He has collected 300 
        taels for each of these murders, and has compelled full payment for all 
        the property belonging to Christians that was destroyed. He also assessed 
        fines amounting to Thirteen Times the amount of the indemnity. This money 
        will be used for the propagation of the Gospel. </p>
      <p>Mr. Ament declares that the compensation he has collected is moderate, 
        when compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who demand, in 
        addition to money, head for head. They collect 500 taels for each murder 
        of a Catholic. In the Wenchiu country, 680 Catholics were killed, and 
        for this the European Catholics here demand 750,000 strings of cash and 
        680 heads. </p>
      <p>In the course of a conversation, Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of 
        the missionaries toward the Chinese. He said: </p>
      <p>'I deny emphatically that the missionaries are vindictive, that they 
        generally looted, or that they have done anything since the siege that 
        the circumstances did not demand. I criticise the Americans. The soft 
        hand of the Americans is not as good as the mailed fist of the Germans. 
        If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand they will take advantage 
        of it.' </p>
      <p>The statement that the French Government will return the loot taken by 
        the French soldiers, is the source of the greatest amusement here. The 
        French soldiers were more systematic looters than the Germans, and it 
        is a fact that to-day Catholic Christians, carrying French flags and armed 
        with modern guns, are looting villages in the Province of Chili.'' </p>
      <p>By happy luck, we get all these glad tidings on Christmas Eve&#151;just 
        in time to enable us to celebrate the day with proper gaiety and enthusiasm. 
        Our spirits soar, and we find we can even make jokes: Taels I win, Heads 
        you lose. </p>
      <p>Our Reverend Ament is the right man in the right place. What we want 
        of our missionaries out there is, not that they shall merely represent 
        in their acts and persons the grace and gentleness and charity and loving 
        kindness of our religion, but that they shall also represent the American 
        spirit. The oldest Americans are the Pawnees. Macallum's History says: 
      </p>
      <p>When a white Boxer kills a Pawnee and destroys his property, the other 
        Pawnees do not trouble to seek him out, they kill any white person that 
        comes along; also, they make some white village pay deceased's heirs the 
        full cash value of deceased, together with full cash value of the property 
        destroyed; they also make the village pay, in addition, thirteen times 
        the value of that property into a fund for the dissemination of the Pawnee 
        religion, which they regard as the best of all religions for the softening 
        and humanizing of the heart of man. It is their idea that it is only fair 
        and right that the innocent should be made to suffer for the guilty, and 
        that it is better that ninety and nine innocent should suffer than that 
        one guilty person should escape.'' </p>
      <p>Our Reverend Ament is justifiably jealous of those enterprising Catholics, 
        who not only get big money for each lost convert, but get ''head for head'' 
        besides. But he should soothe himself with the reflection that the entirety 
        of their exactions are for their own pockets, whereas he, less selfishly, 
        devotes only 300 taels per head to that service, and gives the whole vast 
        thirteen repetitions of the property- indemnity to the service of propagating 
        the Gospel. His magnanimity has won him the approval of his nation, and 
        will get him a monument. Let him be content with these rewards. We all 
        hold him dear for manfully defending his fellow missionaries from exaggerated 
        charges which were beginning to distress us, but which his testimony has 
        so considerably modified that we can now contemplate them without noticeable 
        pain. For now we know that, even before the siege, the missionaries were 
        not ''generally'' out looting, and that, ''since the siege,'' they have 
        acted quite handsomely, except when ''circumstances'' crowded them. I 
        am arranging for the monument. Subscriptions for it can be sent to the 
        American Board; designs for it can be sent to me. Designs must allegorically 
        set forth the Thirteen Reduplications of the Indemnity, and the Object 
        for which they were exacted; as Ornaments, the designs must exhibit 680 
        Heads, so disposed as to give a pleasing and pretty effect; for the Catholics 
        have done nicely, and are entitled to notice in the monument. Mottoes 
        may be suggested, if any shall be discovered that will satisfactorily 
        cover the ground. </p>
      <p>Mr. Ament's financial feat of squeezing a thirteen-fold indemnity out 
        of the pauper peasants to square other people's offenses, thus condemning 
        them and their women and innocent little children to inevitable starvation 
        and lingering death, in order that the blood-money so acquired might be 
        ''used for the propagation of the Gospel,'' does not flutter my serenity; 
        although the act and the words, taken together, concrete a blasphemy so 
        hideous and so colossal that, without doubt, its mate is not findable 
        in the history of this or of any other age. Yet, if a layman had done 
        that thing and justified it with those words. I should have shuddered, 
        I know. Or, if I had done the thing and said the words myself&#151;however, 
        the thought is unthinkable, irreverent as some imperfectly informed people 
        think me. Sometimes an ordained minister sets out to be blasphemous. When 
        this happens, the layman is out of the running; he stands no chance. </p>
      <p>We have Mr. Ament's impassioned assurance that the missionaries are not 
        ''vindictive.'' Let us hope and pray that they will never become so, but 
        will remain in the almost morbidly fair and just and gentle temper which 
        is affording so much satisfaction to their brother and champion to-day. 
      </p>
      <p>The following is from the New York Tribune of Christmas Eve. It comes 
        from that journal's Tokio correspondent. It has a strange and impudent 
        sound, but the Japanese are but partially civilized as yet. When they 
        become wholly civilized they will not talk so: </p>
      <p>''The missionary question, of course, occupies a foremost place in the 
        discussion. It is now felt as essential that the Western Powers take cognizance 
        of the sentiment here, that religious invasions of Oriental countries 
        by powerful Western organizations are tantamount to filibustering expeditions, 
        and should not only be discountenanced, but that stern measures should 
        be adopted for their suppression. The feeling here is that the missionary 
        organizations constitute a constant menace to peaceful international relations.'' 
      </p>
      <p>Shall we? That is, shall we go on conferring our Civilization upon the 
        peoples that sit in darkness, or shall we give those poor things a rest? 
        Shall we bang right ahead in our old-time, loud, pious way, and commit 
        the new century to the game; or shall we sober up and sit down and think 
        it over first? Would it not be prudent to get our Civilization-tools together, 
        and see how much stock is left on hand in the way of Glass Beads and Theology, 
        and Maxim Guns and Hymn Books, and Trade-Gin and Torches of Progress and 
        Enlightenment (patent adjustable ones, good to fire villages with, upon 
        occasion), and balance the books, and arrive at the profit and loss, so 
        that we may intelligently decide whether to continue the business or sell 
        out the property and start a new Civilization Scheme on the proceeds? 
      </p>
      <p>Extending the Blessings of Civilization to our Brother who Sits in Darkness 
        has been a good trade and has paid well, on the whole; and there is money 
        in it yet, if carefully worked&#151;but not enough, in my judgment, to 
        make any considerable risk advisable. The People that Sit in Darkness 
        are getting to be too scarce&#151;too scarce and too shy. And such darkness 
        as is now left is really of but an indifferent quality, and not dark enough 
        for the game. The most of those People that Sit in Darkness have been 
        furnished with more light than was good for them or profitable for us. 
        We have been injudicious. </p>
      <p>The Blessings-of-Civilization Trust, wisely and cautiously administered, 
        is a Daisy. There is more money in it, more territory, more sovereignty, 
        and other kinds of emolument, than there is in any other game that is 
        played. But Christendom has been playing it badly of late years, and must 
        certainly suffer by it, in my opinion. She has been so eager to get every 
        stake that appeared on the green cloth, that the People who Sit in Darkness 
        have noticed it&#151;they have noticed it, and have begun to show alarm. 
        They have become suspicious of the Blessings of Civilization. More&#151;they 
        have begun to examine them. This is not well. The Blessings of Civilization 
        are all right, and a good commercial property; there could not be a better, 
        in a dim light. In the right kind of a light, and at a proper distance, 
        with the goods a little out of focus, they furnish this desirable exhibit 
        to the Gentlemen who Sit in Darkness: </p>
      <p>~~~ Love, Law and Order, Justice, Liberty, Gentleness, Equality, Christianity, 
        Honorable Dealing, Protection to the Weak, Mercy, Temperance, Education, 
        &#151;and so on. </p>
      <p>There. Is it good? Sir, it is pie. It will bring into camp any idiot 
        that sits in darkness anywhere. But not if we adulterate it. It is proper 
        to be emphatic upon that point. This brand is strictly for Export&#151;apparently. 
        Apparently. Privately and confidentially, it is nothing of the kind. Privately 
        and confidentially, it is merely an outside cover, gay and pretty and 
        attractive, displaying the special patterns of our Civilization which 
        we reserve for Home Consumption, while inside the bale is the Actual Thing 
        that the Customer Sitting in Darkness buys with his blood and tears and 
        land and liberty. That Actual Thing is, indeed, Civilization, but it is 
        only for Export. Is there a difference between the two brands? In some 
        of the details, yes. </p>
      <p>We all know that the Business is being ruined. The reason is not far 
        to seek. It is because our Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Chamberlain, and the 
        Kaiser, and the Czar and the French have been exporting the Actual Thing 
        with the outside cover left off. This is bad for the Game. It shows that 
        these new players of it are not sufficiently acquainted with it. </p>
      <p>It is a distress to look on and note the mismoves, they are so strange 
        and so awkward. Mr. Chamberlain manufactures a war out of materials so 
        inadequate and so fanciful that they make the boxes grieve and the gallery 
        laugh, and he tries hard to persuade himself that it isn't purely a private 
        raid for cash, but has a sort of dim, vague respectability about it somewhere, 
        if he could only find the spot; and that, by and by, he can scour the 
        flag clean again after he has finished dragging it through the mud, and 
        make it shine and flash in the vault of heaven once more as it had shone 
        and flashed there a thousand years in the world's respect until he laid 
        his unfaithful hand upon it. It is bad play&#151;bad. For it exposes the 
        Actual Thing to Them that Sit in Darkness, and they say: ''What! Christian 
        against Christian? And only for money? Is this a case of magnanimity, 
        forbearance, love, gentleness, mercy, protection of the weak&#151;this 
        strange and over-showy onslaught of an elephant upon a nest of field-mice, 
        on the pretext that the mice had squeaked an insolence at him&#151;conduct 
        which 'no self-respecting government could allow to pass unavenged?' as 
        Mr. Chamberlain said. Was that a good pretext in a small case, when it 
        had not been a good pretext in a large one?&#151;for only recently Russia 
        had affronted the elephant three times and survived alive and unsmitten. 
        Is this Civilization and Progress? Is it something better than we already 
        possess? These harryings and burnings and desert-makings in the Transvaal&#151;is 
        this an improvement on our darkness? Is it, perhaps, possible that there 
        are two kinds of Civilization&#151;one for home consumption and one for 
        the heathen market?'' </p>
      <p>Then They that Sit in Darkness are troubled, and shake their heads; and 
        they read this extract from a letter of a British private, recounting 
        his exploits in one of Methuen's victories, some days before the affair 
        of Magersfontein, and they are troubled again: </p>
      <p>''We tore up the hill and into the intrenchments, and the Boers saw we 
        had them; so they dropped their guns and went down on their knees and 
        put up their hands clasped, and begged for mercy. And we gave it them&#151; 
        with the long spoon.'' </p>
      <p>The long spoon is the bayonet. See Lloyd's Weekly, London, of those days. 
        The same number&#151;and the same column&#151;contained some quite unconscious 
        satire in the form of shocked and bitter upbraidings of the Boers for 
        their brutalities and inhumanities! </p>
      <p>Next, to our heavy damage, the Kaiser went to playing the game without 
        first mastering it. He lost a couple of missionaries in a riot in Shantung, 
        and in his account he made an overcharge for them. China had to pay a 
        hundred thousand dollars apiece for them, in money; twelve miles of territory, 
        containing several millions of inhabitants and worth twenty million dollars; 
        and to build a monument, and also a Christian church; whereas the people 
        of China could have been depended upon to remember the missionaries without 
        the help of these expensive memorials. This was all bad play. Bad, because 
        it would not, and could not, and will not now or ever, deceive the Person 
        Sitting in Darkness. He knows that it was an overcharge. He knows that 
        a missionary is like any other man: he is worth merely what you can supply 
        his place for, and no more. He is useful, but so is a doctor, so is a 
        sheriff, so is an editor; but a just Emperor does not charge war-prices 
        for such. A diligent, intelligent, but obscure missionary, and a diligent, 
        intelligent country editor are worth much, and we know it; but they are 
        not worth the earth. We esteem such an editor, and we are sorry to see 
        him go; but, when he goes, we should consider twelve miles of territory, 
        and a church, and a fortune, over-compensation for his loss. I mean, if 
        he was a Chinese editor, and we had to settle for him. It is no proper 
        figure for an editor or a missionary; one can get shop-worn kings for 
        less. It was bad play on the Kaiser's part. It got this property, true; 
        but it produced the Chinese revolt, the indignant uprising of China's 
        traduced patriots, the Boxers. The results have been expensive to Germany, 
        and to the other Disseminators of Progress and the Blessings of Civilization. 
      </p>
      <p>The Kaiser's claim was paid, yet it was bad play, for it could not fail 
        to have an evil effect upon Persons Sitting in Darkness in China. They 
        would muse upon the event, and be likely to say: ''Civilization is gracious 
        and beautiful, for such is its reputation; but can we afford it? There 
        are rich Chinamen, perhaps they could afford it; but this tax is not laid 
        upon them, it is laid upon the peasants of Shantung; it is they that must 
        pay this mighty sum, and their wages are but four cents a day. Is this 
        a better civilization than ours, and holier and higher and nobler? Is 
        not this rapacity? Is not this extortion? Would Germany charge America 
        two hundred thousand dollars for two missionaries, and shake the mailed 
        fist in her face, and send warships, and send soldiers, and say: 'Seize 
        twelve miles of territory, worth twenty millions of dollars, as additional 
        pay for the missionaries; and make those peasants build a monument to 
        the missionaries, and a costly Christian church to remember them by?' 
        And later would Germany say to her soldiers: 'March through America and 
        slay, giving no quarter; make the German face there, as has been our Hunface 
        here, a terror for a thousand years; march through the Great Republic 
        and slay, slay, slay, carving a road for our offended religion through 
        its heart and bowels? Would Germany do like this to America, to England, 
        to France, to Russia? Or only to China the helpless&#151;imitating the 
        elephant's assault upon the field-mice? Had we better invest in this Civilization&#151;this 
        Civilization which called Napoleon a buccaneer for carrying off Venice's 
        bronze horses, but which steals our ancient astronomical instruments from 
        our walls, and goes looting like common bandits&#151;that is, all the 
        alien soldiers except America's; and (Americans again excepted) storms 
        frightened villages and cables the result to glad journals at home every 
        day: 'Chinese losses, 450 killed; ours, one officer and two men wounded. 
        Shall proceed against neighboring village to-morrow, where a massacre 
        is reported.' Can we afford Civilization?'' </p>
      <p>And, next, Russia must go and play the game injudiciously. She affronts 
        England once or twice&#151;with the Person Sitting in Darkness observing 
        and noting; by moral assistance of France and Germany, she robs Japan 
        of her hard-earned spoil, all swimming in Chinese blood&#151;Port Arthur&#151;with 
        the Person again observing and noting; then she seizes Manchuria, raids 
        its villages, and chokes its great river with the swollen corpses of countless 
        massacred peasants&#151;that astonished Person still observing and noting. 
        And perhaps he is saying to himself: ''It is yet another Civilized Power, 
        with its banner of the Prince of Peace in one hand and its loot-basket 
        and its butcher-knife in the other. Is there no salvation for us but to 
        adopt Civilization and lift ourselves down to its level?'' </p>
      <p>And by and by comes America, and our Master of the Game plays it badly&#151;plays 
        it as Mr. Chamberlain was playing it in South Africa. It was a mistake 
        to do that; also, it was one which was quite unlooked for in a Master 
        who was playing it so well in Cuba. In Cuba, he was playing the usual 
        and regular American game, and it was winning, for there is no way to 
        beat it. The Master, contemplating Cuba, said: ''Here is an oppressed 
        and friendless little nation which is willing to fight to be free; we 
        go partners, and put up the strength of seventy million sympathizers and 
        the resources of the United States: play!'' Nothing but Europe combined 
        could call that hand: and Europe cannot combine on anything. There, in 
        Cuba, he was following our great traditions in a way which made us very 
        proud of him, and proud of the deep dissatisfaction which his play was 
        provoking in Continental Europe. Moved by a high inspiration, he threw 
        out those stirring words which proclaimed that forcible annexation would 
        be ''criminal aggression;'' and in that utterance fired another ''shot 
        heard round the world.'' The memory of that fine saying will be outlived 
        by the remembrance of no act of his but one&#151;that he forgot it within 
        the twelvemonth, and its honorable gospel along with it. </p>
      <p>For, presently, came the Philippine temptation. It was strong; it was 
        too strong, and he made that bad mistake: he played the European game, 
        the Chamberlain game. It was a pity; it was a great pity, that error; 
        that one grievous error, that irrevocable error. For it was the very place 
        and time to play the American game again. And at no cost. Rich winnings 
        to be gathered in, too; rich and permanent; indestructible; a fortune 
        transmissible forever to the children of the flag. Not land, not money, 
        not dominion&#151;no, something worth many times more than that dross: 
        our share, the spectacle of a nation of long harassed and persecuted slaves 
        set free through our influence; our posterity's share, the golden memory 
        of that fair deed. The game was in our hands. If it had been played according 
        to the American rules, Dewey would have sailed away from Manila as soon 
        as he had destroyed the Spanish fleet&#151;after putting up a sign on 
        shore guaranteeing foreign property and life against damage by the Filipinos, 
        and warning the Powers that interference with the emancipated patriots 
        would be regarded as an act unfriendly to the United States. The Powers 
        cannot combine, in even a bad cause, and the sign would not have been 
        molested. </p>
      <p>Dewey could have gone about his affairs elsewhere, and left the competent 
        Filipino army to starve out the little Spanish garrison and send it home, 
        and the Filipino citizens to set up the form of government they might 
        prefer, and deal with the friars and their doubtful acquisitions according 
        to Filipino ideas of fairness and justice&#151;ideas which have since 
        been tested and found to be of as high an order as any that prevail in 
        Europe or America. </p>
      <p>But we played the Chamberlain game, and lost the chance to add another 
        Cuba and another honorable deed to our good record. </p>
      <p>The more we examine the mistake, the more clearly we perceive that it 
        is going to be bad for the Business. The Person Sitting in Darkness is 
        almost sure to say: ''There is something curious about this&#151;curious 
        and unaccountable. There must be two Americas: one that sets the captive 
        free, and one that takes a once-captive's new freedom away from him, and 
        picks a quarrel with him with nothing to found it on; then kills him to 
        get his land.'' </p>
      <p>The truth in, the Person Sitting in Darkness is saying things like that; 
        and for the sake of the Business we must persuade him to look at the Philippine 
        matter in another and healthier way. We must arrange his opinions for 
        him. I believe it can be done; for Mr. Chamberlain has arranged England's 
        opinion of the South African matter, and done it most cleverly and successfully. 
        He presented the facts&#151;some of the facts&#151;and showed those confiding 
        people what the facts meant. He did it statistically, which is a good 
        way. He used the formula: ''Twice 2 are 14, and 2 from 9 leaves 35.'' 
        Figures are effective; figures will convince the elect. </p>
      <p>Now, my plan is a still bolder one than Mr. Chamberlain's, though apparently 
        a copy of it. Let us be franker than Mr. Chamberlain; let us audaciously 
        present the whole of the facts, shirking none, then explain them according 
        to Mr. Chamberlain's formula. This daring truthfulness will astonish and 
        dazzle the Person Sitting in Darkness, and he will take the Explanation 
        down before his mental vision has had time to get back into focus. Let 
        us say to him: </p>
      <p>''Our case is simple. On the 1st of May, Dewey destroyed the Spanish 
        fleet. This left the Archipelago in the hands of its proper and rightful 
        owners, the Filipino nation. Their army numbered 30,000 men, and they 
        were competent to whip out or starve out the little Spanish garrison; 
        then the people could set up a government of their own devising. Our traditions 
        required that Dewey should now set up his warning sign, and go away. But 
        the Master of the Game happened to think of another plan&#151;the European 
        plan. He acted upon it. This was, to send out an army&#151;ostensibly 
        to help the native patriots put the finishing touch upon their long and 
        plucky struggle for independence, but really to take their land away from 
        them and keep it. That is, in the interest of Progress and Civilization. 
        The plan developed, stage by stage, and quite satisfactorily. We entered 
        into a military alliance with the trusting Filipinos, and they hemmed 
        in Manila on the land side, and by their valuable help the place, with 
        its garrison of 8,000 or 10,000 Spaniards, was captured&#151;a thing which 
        we could not have accomplished unaided at that time. We got their help 
        by&#151;by ingenuity. We knew they were fighting for their independence, 
        and that they had been at it for two years. We knew they supposed that 
        we also were fighting in their worthy cause&#151;just as we had helped 
        the Cubans fight for Cuban independence&#151;and we allowed them to go 
        on thinking so. Until Manila was ours and we could get along without them. 
        Then we showed our hand. Of course, they were surprised&#151;that was 
        natural; surprised and disappointed; disappointed and grieved. To them 
        it looked un-American; uncharacteristic; foreign to our established traditions. 
        And this was natural, too; for we were only playing the American Game 
        in public&#151;in private it was the European. It was neatly done, very 
        neatly, and it bewildered them. They could not understand it; for we had 
        been so friendly&#151;so affectionate, even&#151;with those simple-minded 
        patriots! We, our own selves, had brought back out of exile their leader, 
        their hero, their hope, their Washington&#151;Aguinaldo; brought him in 
        a warship, in high honor, under the sacred shelter and hospitality of 
        the flag; brought him back and restored him to his people, and got their 
        moving and eloquent gratitude for it. Yes, we had been so friendly to 
        them, and had heartened them up in so many ways! We had lent them guns 
        and ammunition; advised with them; exchanged pleasant courtesies with 
        them; placed our sick and wounded in their kindly care; entrusted our 
        Spanish prisoners to their humane and honest hands; fought shoulder to 
        shoulder with them against 'the common enemy' (our own phrase); praised 
        their courage, praised their gallantry, praised their mercifulness, praised 
        their fine and honorable conduct; borrowed their trenches, borrowed strong 
        positions which they had previously captured from the Spaniard; petted 
        them, lied to them&#151;officially proclaiming that our land and naval 
        forces came to give them their freedom and displace the bad Spanish Government&#151;fooled 
        them, used them until we needed them no longer; then derided the sucked 
        orange and threw it away. We kept the positions which we had beguiled 
        them of; by and by, we moved a force forward and overlapped patriot ground&#151;a 
        clever thought, for we needed trouble, and this would produce it. A Filipino 
        soldier, crossing the ground, where no one had a right to forbid him, 
        was shot by our sentry. The badgered patriots resented this with arms, 
        without waiting to know whether Aguinaldo, who was absent, would approve 
        or not. Aguinaldo did not approve; but that availed nothing. What we wanted, 
        in the interest of Progress and Civilization, was the Archipelago, unencumbered 
        by patriots struggling for independence; and War was what we needed. We 
        clinched our opportunity. It is Mr. Chamberlain's case over again&#151;at 
        least in its motive and intention; and we played the game as adroitly 
        as he played it himself.'' </p>
      <p>At this point in our frank statement of fact to the Person Sitting in 
        Darkness, we should throw in a little trade-taffy about the Blessings 
        of Civilization&#151;for a change, and for the refreshment of his spirit&#151;then 
        go on with our tale: </p>
      <p>''We and the patriots having captured Manila, Spain's ownership of the 
        Archipelago and her sovereignty over it were at an end&#151;obliterated&#151;annihilated&#151;not 
        a rag or shred of either remaining behind. It was then that we conceived 
        the divinely humorous idea of buying both of these spectres from Spain! 
        [It is quite safe to confess this to the Person Sitting in Darkness, since 
        neither he nor any other sane person will believe it.] In buying those 
        ghosts for twenty millions, we also contracted to take care of the friars 
        and their accumulations. I think we also agreed to propagate leprosy and 
        smallpox, but as to this there is doubt. But it is not important; persons 
        afflicted with the friars do not mind other diseases. </p>
      <p>''With our Treaty ratified, Manila subdued, and our Ghosts secured, we 
        had no further use for Aguinaldo and the owners of the Archipelago. We 
        forced a war, and we have been hunting America's guest and ally through 
        the woods and swamps ever since.'' </p>
      <p>At this point in the tale, it will be well to boast a little of our war-work 
        and our heroisms in the field, so as to make our performance look as fine 
        as England's in South Africa; but I believe it will not be best to emphasize 
        this too much. We must be cautious. Of course, we must read the war-telegrams 
        to the Person, in order to keep up our frankness; but we can throw an 
        air of humorousness over them, and that will modify their grim eloquence 
        a little, and their rather indiscreet exhibitions of gory exultation. 
        Before reading to him the following display heads of the dispatches of 
        November 18, 1900, it will be well to practice on them in private first, 
        so as to get the right tang of lightness and gaiety into them: </p>
      <p>''Administration Weary of Protracted Hostilities!'' ''Real War Ahead 
        for Filipino Rebels!'' ''Will Show No Mercy!'' ''Kitchener's Plan Adopted!'' 
      </p>
      <p>Kitchener knows how to handle disagreeable people who are fighting for 
        their homes and their liberties, and we must let on that we are merely 
        imitating Kitchener, and have no national interest in the matter, further 
        than to get ourselves admired by the Great Family of Nations, in which 
        august company our Master of the Game has bought a place for us in the 
        back row. </p>
      <p>Of course, we must not venture to ignore our General MacArthur's reports&#151;oh, 
        why do they keep on printing those embarrassing things?&#151;we must drop 
        them trippingly from the tongue and take the chances: </p>
      <p>''During the last ten months our losses have been 268 killed and 750 
        wounded; Filipino loss, three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven killed, 
        and 694 wounded.'' </p>
      <p>We must stand ready to grab the Person Sitting in Darkness, for he will 
        swoon away at this confession, saying: ''Good God, those 'niggers' spare 
        their wounded, and the Americans massacre theirs!'' </p>
      <p>We must bring him to, and coax him and coddle him, and assure him that 
        the ways of Providence are best, and that it would not become us to find 
        fault with them; and then, to show him that we are only imitators, not 
        originators, we must read the following passage from the letter of an 
        American soldier-lad in the Philippines to his mother, published in Public 
        Opinion, of Decorah, Iowa, describing the finish of a victorious battle: 
      </p>
      <p>''We never left one alive. If one was wounded, we would run our bayonets 
        through him.'' </p>
      <p>Having now laid all the historical facts before the Person Sitting in 
        Darkness, we should bring him to again, and explain them to him. We should 
        say to him: </p>
      <p>''They look doubtful, but in reality they are not. There have been lies; 
        yes, but they were told in a good cause. We have been treacherous; but 
        that was only in order that real good might come out of apparent evil. 
        True, we have crushed a deceived and confiding people; we have turned 
        against the weak and the friendless who trusted us; we have stamped out 
        a just and intelligent and well-ordered republic; we have stabbed an ally 
        in the back and slapped the face of a guest; we have bought a Shadow from 
        an enemy that hadn't it to sell; we have robbed a trusting friend of his 
        land and his liberty; we have invited our clean young men to shoulder 
        a discredited musket and do bandit's work under a flag which bandits have 
        been accustomed to fear, not to follow; we have debauched America's honor 
        and blackened her face before the world; but each detail was for the best. 
        We know this. The Head of every State and Sovereignty in Christendom and 
        ninety per cent. of every legislative body in Christendom, including our 
        Congress and our fifty State Legislatures, are members not only of the 
        church, but also of the Blessings-of- Civilization Trust. This world-girdling 
        accumulation of trained morals, high principles, and justice, cannot do 
        an unright thing, an unfair thing, an ungenerous thing, and unclean thing. 
        It knows what it is about. Give yourself no uneasiness; it is all right.'' 
      </p>
      <p>Now then, that will convince the Person. You will see. It will restore 
        the Business. Also, it will elect the Master of the Game to the vacant 
        place in the Trinity of our national gods; and there on their high thrones 
        the Three will sit, age after age, in the people's sight, each bearing 
        the Emblem of his service: Washington, the Sword of the Liberator; Lincoln, 
        the Slave's Broken Chains; the Master, the Chains Repaired. </p>
      <p>It will give the Business a splendid new start. You will see. </p>
      <p>Everything is prosperous, now; everything is just as we should wish it. 
        We have got the Archipelago, and we shall never give it up. Also, we have 
        every reason to hope that we shall have an opportunity before very long 
        to slip out of our Congressional contract with Cuba and give her something 
        better in the place of it. It is a rich country, and many of us are already 
        beginning to see that the contract was a sentimental mistake. But now&#151;right 
        now&#151;is the best time to do some profitable rehabilitating work&#151;work 
        that will set us up and make us comfortable, and discourage gossip. We 
        cannot conceal from ourselves that, privately, we are a little troubled 
        about our uniform. It is one of our prides; it is acquainted with honor; 
        it is familiar with great deeds and noble; we love it, we revere it; and 
        so this errand it is on makes us uneasy. And our flag&#151;another pride 
        of ours, our chiefest! We have worshipped it so; and when we have seen 
        it in far lands&#151;glimpsing it unexpectedly in that strange sky, waving 
        its welcome and benediction to us&#151;we have caught our breath, and 
        uncovered our heads, and couldn't speak, for a moment, for the thought 
        of what it was to us and the great ideals it stood for. Indeed, we must 
        do something about these things; we must not have the flag out there, 
        and the uniform. They are not needed there; we can manage in some other 
        way. England manages, as regards the uniform, and so can we. We have to 
        send soldiers&#151;we can't get out of that&#151;but we can disguise them. 
        It is the way England does in South Africa. Even Mr. Chamberlain himself 
        takes pride in England's honorable uniform, and makes the army down there 
        wear an ugly and odious and appropriate disguise, of yellow stuff such 
        as quarantine flags are made of, and which are hoisted to warn the healthy 
        away from unclean disease and repulsive death. This cloth is called khaki. 
        We could adopt it. It is light, comfortable, grotesque, and deceives the 
        enemy, for he cannot conceive of a soldier being concealed in it. </p>
      <p>And so for a flag for the Philippine Province, it is easily managed. 
        We can have a special one&#151;our States do it; we can have just our 
        usual flag, with the white stripes painted black and the stars replaced 
        by the skull and cross-bones. </p>
      <p>And we do not need that Civil Commission out there. Having no powers, 
        it has to invent them, and that kind of work cannot be effectively done 
        by just anybody; an expert is required. Mr. Croker can be spared. We do 
        not want the United States represented there, but only the Game. </p>
      <p>By help of these suggested amendments, Progress and Civilization in that 
        country can have a boom, and it will take in the Persons who are Sitting 
        in Darkness, and we can resume Business at the old stand. </p>
